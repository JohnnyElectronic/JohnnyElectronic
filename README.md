Hello and welcome, I've been playing and working with electronics for over 50 years. I've had a variety of positions during that time from Electronic Technician to Computer Engineer. I enjoy building things and love putting electronics into hobby models and other projects. 
Take a look at some of my projects and if you woulkd like to also add some electronics to your own models look at the various development boards I have available.
